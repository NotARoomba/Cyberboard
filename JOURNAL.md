## 10/13/2025 - Chip Selection and Schematic Start  

First I'm starting to define the functionality of the board. I want it to be the size of a Raspberry Pi Pico, and I want it to have Bluetooth support as well as headers for the STM32. I also want a JST connector to charge a 1S LiPo Battery for portability so I need a battery charging IC.

Chip Selection:

- STM32WB55CG
- TPS630701RNMR (Buck-Boost Converter)
- BQ24074 (Battery Charger)

Extras:

- SPI LEDs
- USB LEDs
- Battery JST Connector
- USB-C
- Ceramic Bluetooth Antenna
