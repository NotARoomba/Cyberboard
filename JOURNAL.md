This is my journal of the design and building process of **Cyberboard**.

## 10/13/2025 - Chip Selection and Schematic Start  

First I'm starting to define the functionality of the board. I want it to be the size of a Raspberry Pi Pico, and I want it to have Bluetooth support as well as headers for the STM32. I also want a JST connector to charge a 1S LiPo Battery for portability so I need a battery charging IC.

Chip Selection:

- STM32WB55CG
- TPS630701RNMR (Buck-Boost Converter)
- BQ24074 (Battery Charger)

Extras:

- SPI LEDs
- USB LEDs
- Battery JST Connector
- USB-C
- Ceramic Bluetooth Antenna

## 10/15/2025 - Finish Schematic and PCB Routing  

I started looking through all of the datasheets of all of the parts that I used to get the reference designs for each of the chips and then started wiring up each component.

I then ended up with this:

I still have to wire out the headers but I'm planning on doing that last after I have all the passive components in place.
