This is my journal of the design and building process of **Cyberboard**.

## 10/13/2025 - Chip Selection and Schematic Start  

First I'm starting to define the functionality of the board. I want it to be the size of a Raspberry Pi Pico, and I want it to have Bluetooth support as well as headers for the STM32. I also want a JST connector to charge a 1S LiPo Battery for portability so I need a battery charging IC.

Chip Selection:

- STM32WB55CG
- TPS630701RNMR (Buck-Boost Converter)
- BQ24074 (Battery Charger)

Extras:

- SPI LEDs
- USB LEDs
- Battery JST Connector
- USB-C
- Ceramic Bluetooth Antenna

## 10/15/2025 12 AM - Finish Schematic and PCB Routing  

I started looking through all of the datasheets of all of the parts that I used to get the reference designs for each of the chips and then started wiring up each component.

I then ended up with this:

I still have to wire out the headers but I'm planning on doing that last after I have all the passive components in place.

## 10/15/2025 10 PM - Layout and Finish Board  

I decided to finish the layout and during, I wanted to add an LED and also the debugging pins as test points on the bottom of the board.

I then started routing all of the GPIO's first, then the clocks and then the power stuff. I used .2mm traces for everything that wasn't power and .4mm traces for power.

I also had to impedance match the antenna so basing it off this datasheet:

I then added the traces and also put stitching vias on the side. I also added the keepout zone and made sure that the ground plane on either side had the right clearance.

After that I finished adding the ground pours and ran DRC to fix the remaining errors and finally got this.

After finishing the board I decided to do some renders in Blender and here are the photos.

## 10/16/2025 - Resized Keep-out zone  

I decided to resize the keep-out zone after some advice from my informatics teacher and looking online at the datasheet. It originally says to have a 6.5mm space but I don't have that much space horizontally as I do vertically so the most I could do was 4.3mm.
